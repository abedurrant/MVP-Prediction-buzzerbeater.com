# MVP-Prediction-buzzerbeater.com
This is a small project I worked on for a game I play. Includes basic applications of machine learning to predict the MVP votes in an online basketball manager game at buzzerbeater.com.

Includes:

Organization and engineering of the training data
Train/test split to test various machine learning models
Predictions generated for a league

Yet to do:
In depth EDA to recognize changes across seasons
Cross validation to tune parameters
More feature engineering
